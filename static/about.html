    <h1 class="headText db">How the model Works?</h1>
    <p class="text">Our X-Ray Image Captioning Model is a deep learning model designed to generate accurate and
      meaningful descriptions of chest X-ray images. The model uses a combination of convolutional neural networks
      (CNNs) to extract features from the X-ray images and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to generate
      captions.<br><br>

      To train the model, we used a dataset of chest X-ray images from Indiana University, which contains over 7,000
      images along with corresponding captions. We preprocessed the images and captions and used a tokenizer to convert
      the captions into numerical sequences that can be fed into the model. We also used transfer learning to
      incorporate a pre-trained image recognition model, which helped to improve the accuracy of the image feature
      extraction.

      The model was trained over 15 epochs, with a batch size of 32 and using a categorical cross-entropy loss function
      and the Adam optimizer. The training process was done using a data generator to avoid session crashes.<br><br>

      Our model achieved an impressive BLEU-4 score of 0.31, indicating that its generated captions are highly similar
      to human-generated captions. We have also developed a web application that allows users to upload chest X-ray
      images and receive an automatic caption generated by the model.<br><br>

      We hope that our X-Ray Image Captioning Model can be used as a valuable tool in the healthcare industry, providing
      radiologists and healthcare professionals with an accurate and efficient way to generate image descriptions, which
      can improve patient care and diagnosis accuracy. Additionally, our model serves as an excellent example of how
      deep learning can be applied to a variety of fields and domains, highlighting the versatility and potential of
      this exciting technology.
