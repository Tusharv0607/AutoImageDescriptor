## Introduction
The X-Ray Analyzer provides an interactive platform for users to upload X-ray images and generate description for those images using a deep learning model. 
The model combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate meaningful textual descriptions that accurately represent the content of the X-ray images. 
This can be useful in medical diagnosis, research, and educational applications.

## Requirements
To run the website, you need the following dependencies:
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Flask (1.0 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Tusharv0607/AutoImageDescriptor.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Start the Flask server: python app.py
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Upload an X-ray image using the provided interface.
4. Click the "Get Results" button to process the image and display the generated caption.
5. Repeat the process for additional images.

## Dataset
The deep learning model used by the website is trained on a dataset of X-ray images along with their corresponding captions for training. 

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model used in this project is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and LSTM based recurrent neural networks (RNN). The CNN is responsible for extracting image features, while the LSTM generates the textual captions based on the extracted features.
The architecture consists of an image encoder and a caption decoder. The image encoder is typically a pre-trained CNN (VGG16) that is used to encode the X-ray images into a fixed-length vector of features. 
The caption decoder is an RNN (LSTM) that generates results word by word based on the encoded image features.

## Website Structure
The website structure is as follows:
- The `app.py` file contains the Flask application code, including the routes for handling image uploads and generating captions.
- The `templates` directory contains the HTML templates for the website pages.
- The `static` directory contains the CSS and JavaScript files used for styling and interactivity.
